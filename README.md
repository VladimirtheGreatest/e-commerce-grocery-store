This is a fictional e-commerce vegan grocery store including basic menu and store layout,shopping cart, shopping list etc.(built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootsrap.) This e-commerce store will provide customers option to choose from the range of vegan products. Chosen products will be added to the shopping cart in the top left corner. Shopping cart will be revealed with the animation as a fixed side-menu. Customer will be able to see chosen products and modify the cart by adding more or deleting (using either individual delete button for each and every single product or "clear cart" button. Once decided to purchase chosen products, customer will be able to check-out and finish the shopping by proceeding to the payment page. Website is fully responsive and tested on desktops, tablets and mobile phones. This project should demonstrate my ability to create an e-commerce online store with html, css and provide functionality by manipulating dom elements with javascript. It should also demonstrate my ability to make a fully responsive web design.
